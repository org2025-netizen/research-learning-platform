# Research Learning Platform

A hybrid **research + learning hub** that combines a Learning Management System (LMS), a personal research library, and data analysis tools. Designed for students, researchers, and curious learners who want to study, organize knowledge, and analyze data in one place.

## 🚀 Vision
To create an accessible platform where learners can:
- Take structured courses with quizzes and interactive content.
- Upload and annotate research papers (PDFs, images).
- Manage citations and notes.
- Run code (Python/R) and visualize datasets directly in the browser.

---

## 🎯 Target Audience
- University students (e.g., Computer Science, Statistics, Biology).
- Professional researchers managing literature and datasets.
- Educators designing interactive learning paths.
- Hobbyists curious about data science and research workflows.
